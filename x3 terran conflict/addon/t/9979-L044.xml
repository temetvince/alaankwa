      <t id="1">\033GHello, and welcome to the \033YAlaankwa\033G game start! This is quite a unique start. You cannot buy new ships, and you cannot sell any ships. There are no secret abandoned ships for you to claim at the game start. You get new ships in \033B4\033G ways:\n\033B1.\033C Buying used ships through missions\n\033B2.\033C Claiming bailed ships\n\033B3.\033C Piracy\n\033B4.\033C Building them yourself\033G\nYou can build ships using either the \033MPlayer Headquarters\033G or a \033Mcarrier\033G. To order new production in a \033Mcarrier\033G, see the \033RManage Mothership\033G command in the \033RSpecial\033G commands menu of the \033Mcarrier's\033R Command Console\033G.\n\nTo build a ship, you need a ship \033Oblueprint\033G, and not all \033Oblueprints\033G are created equal. \033OBlueprints\033G differ not only by ship \033Wtype\033G but also by \033Cefficiency\033G. A more \033Cefficient \033Oblueprint\033G will cost fewer resources to produce the same ship \033Wtype\033G. There are \033B%s\033G \033Cefficiency\033G levels of \033Oblueprints\033G per ship \033Wtype\033G. If you own a ship, you automatically get the most \033Cefficient\033G \033Oblueprint\033G for that ship \033Wtype\033G, even if you just finished producing the ship using the least \033Cefficient \033Oblueprint\033G!\n\nYou can use the Data Scanner found on all shipboard computers to scan ships with less than \033B%s\%\033G shields. Of course, most factions consider instrusive probing like this a hostile act! If you don't yet have the best \033Oblueprint\033G for a given ship \033Wtype\033G, then each scan of that \033Wtype\033G yields a better understanding of how to build the ship, hence giving you a more \033Cefficient \033Oblueprint\033G. Note that you can only scan each individual ship once. \033RThe Data Scanner is a hotkey, don't forget to set it!\033X</t>
