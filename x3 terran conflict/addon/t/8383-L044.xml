 <t id="2244">A combined shipment of Alazhi and Kavam microbial particles, these microbes are the primary active ingredients in Bacta, a healing liquid used throughout the galaxy for a wide variety of medical needs..(||) Unlike the pure and naturally-occuring microbes on the planet Thyferra, these microbes were most likely produced at an orbital factory elsewhere in the galaxy.</t>
 <t id="2254">An otherwise mundane cardboard box, these New Republic cereal boxes are used in Admiral Ackbar's galactic breakfast cereal business.(||) These specially-branded boxes contain a lot of useful information about the overwhelming magnitude of Ackbar Cereal's flavors.</t>
 <t id="2314">This product is based on the phenomenon of a time and space anomaly observed in the presence of a singularity. The SETA is an attachment to the ship's normal operational engine, which can, when activated, compress time. The invention was clearly made to shorten travel across vast distances. Side effects due to long term use are unknown.</t>
 <t id="2394">This creature is a small unintelligent space fly that lives in the vast emptiness of deep space. They are the size of a small bird and are made out of delicate shinning gossamer that reacts to light in a multitude of colours. The space flies are becoming increasingly rare due to the harvesting campaigns of the Split, who use the small space fly to power their spaceships.</t>
 <t id="2444">Live shipments of Bantha cattle.(||) This livestock is processed by Dairy farms to produce Bantha Milk, also known as Blue Milk.</t>
 <t id="2544">Republic Nutrient Paste is the primary ingredient for ration packs, used to feed the Clone Army. While the paste itself contains all the nutrients needed for life, it is disgusting to eat, and thus needs to be processed further before consumption.(||) The Republic has been known to feed raw nutrient paste to prisioneers held at Coruscant prisons.</t>
 <t id="2554">Durasteel is commonly used throughout the galaxy as a building material or armor plating material due to its exceptional durability.(||) Essential to the construction of starships, this metal is a common sight on major shipbuilding planets.</t>
 <t id="2707">{17,7741} {17,1000}</t>
 <t id="2708">This factory produces fright drones.</t>
 <t id="2715">{17,541} {17,1005}</t>
 <t id="2716">This station, while resembling the Xenon station at a glance, is what appears to be a staging point, or outpost facility for the Omicron Channel Virus.</t>
 <t id="2725">{17,540} {17,6161}</t>
 <t id="2726">The Phanon Station, considering the company's seemingly able to attain any financial goal it sets, is a humble outpost. High level security systems and protocols leave few tales to be told in regards to the station's interior. Nonetheless, this is the central Phanon Headquarters which operated by whatever current subsidiary is currently willing to do the mysterious corporation's bidding.</t>
 <t id="2811">{17,2813} {17,1000}</t>
 <t id="2812">This production facility produces the Chaff countermeasure.</t>
 <t id="2813">Chaff</t>
 <t id="2814">The chaff is a counter measure ordnance for use with missile defence systems. The chaff travels at extremely high velocities. The defensive range of the chaff depends on the "missile to missile" guidance computer on-board the host ship.</t>
 <t id="2824">The wasp missile is a light multi-warhead missile. It is fast, accurate, and often used to distract a turrets defensive capability due to its low cost and special properties.</t>
 <t id="2834">The dragonfly missile exhibits a small damage footprint, and a tremendous velocity. It is typically used by fighter wings when facing frigates or other more agile capital ships.</t>
 <t id="2845">The silkworm missile is a mid-range standard fighter weapon capable of solid damage output. A common missile due to its versatility.</t>
 <t id="2854">The hornet missile is one of the most devastating weapons known in the Universe. With modest speed and manoeuvrability, the hornet unleashes a devastating impact.</t>
 <t id="3182">A typical Argon Space station used throughout entire Argon federation territory. Developed by Argon over many years, these space stations provide the highest standards of both comfort and technology. Each station is fitted with bars, restaurants, casinos, holographic cinemas and accommodation. They are fine rest and recreation centres.</t>
 <t id="3482">This space station is highly developed and features the latest in Paranid technology. Due to their secretive nature, however, very few people are allowed inside its inner body. Paranid space stations trade mainly with Teladi, Split, and Boron. A Priest Duke commands each space station. It is however believed that each station contains a Paranid temple, access as usual is strictly restricted to Paranid Monks.</t>
 <t id="3582">Teladi space stations are basically functional but not built for comfort; they are solely built for trading purposes. On these stations, everything has a price; one that is generally higher than found at other race's stations. Much of the hi-tech equipment on-board the station has been bought or traded, and so the station inside appears to be a strange hybrid mixture of the various race's technologies.</t>
 <t id="3782">Despite the pirates calling their base a space station, this pirate base is actually constructed from the hulks of old transporter ships. It is heavily camouflaged and has been proven difficult to locate. Pirate stations are typically well guarded, and any ship that approaches is automatically scanned for concealed weapons to ensure they are not carrying police or enemy fighters. Once accepted at the station, a pilot may trade in any number of restricted wares.</t>
 <t id="3812">The Split design of the Orinoco competes with the new Super Transporters, a class of heavy shielded transporter ships with massive cargo bays. While the Orinoco still maintains its super transporter class status, the Split opted for a cheaper design to keep production costs in check.</t>
 <t id="3822">The Bayamon is a destroyer to be feared. More agile and its older counter-parts, this M2 ship doesn't compromise its astonishing speed with it's shielding and ability to deliver devastating firepower when called upon.</t>
 <t id="3832">An improvement upon the Cerberus, this expensive frigate is nimble, and heavier shielded. The Argon military sees the Mandalay as a mainstay of the composition of their forward fleet.</t>
 <t id="3923">Terran Lasertower</t>
 <t id="4163">{17,544} {17,16031}</t>
 <t id="4164">The Plutarch Mining company set up these outposts when the mineral boom took hold on Argon space. Miners from all over the Universe were gripped by the fever of striking it rich while prospecting for rare minerals. These outposts will buy any minerals that can be found while mining debris.</t>
 <t id="4165">{17,549} {17,16031}</t>
 <t id="4166">Not to be outdone by their long term rival, Plutarch, the NMMC set up these outposts shortly after they did. Miners from all over the Universe were gripped by the fever of striking it rich while prospecting for rare minerals. These outposts will buy any minerals that can be found while mining debris.</t>
 <t id="4167">{17,528} {17,16031}</t>
 <t id="4168">Serving pirate clans throughout the galaxy, these outposts are used to gather the raw materials required to build ships at local pirate shipyards. Miners from all over the Universe were gripped by the fever of striking it rich while prospecting for rare minerals. These outposts will buy any minerals that can be found while mining debris.</t>
 <t id="4169">{17,533} {17,16031}</t>
 <t id="4170">The Terran economy greatly benefits from the attention these outposts receive from local prospectors. Miners from all over the Universe were gripped by the fever of striking it rich while prospecting for rare minerals. These outposts will buy any minerals that can be found while mining debris.</t>
 <t id="4624">Medium Class Weapon\n\nThe Boron developed this weapon in an effort to enhance the ability of their fighters to quickly strip the shields of their enemies. The Ion Disruptor has a respectable range and alarming velocity which accomplishes it's primary design goal; however, once the shields are stripped, the Boron military advises their pilots to switch to a conventional weapon.</t>
 <t id="4634">Tool Class Laser\n\nThe Mobile Drilling System accelerates small fast rotating helical particles which drill into rock. The projectiles supersonic resonance to break up minerals and resources within the rock's internal structure. The system comes pre-fit with interfaces for use with an ore collector, which beams the freed resources aboard the ship's cargo hold.</t>
 <t id="4644">Light Class Weapon\n\nThe lightest OCV weapon, it is still a fearsome piece of technology on fighter craft, outclassing any other fighter weapon in the known Universe. Due to its recent emergence on the black market shortly after the OCV announcement in the Omicron Channel, very little is known about this laser weapon.</t>
 <t id="4654">Heavy Class Weapon\n\nOCV M6 and M7 ships are known to be carrying these killers. As will all OCV weaponry, the beta kyon emitter out-guns any other laser in its class. Due to its recent emergence on the black market shortly after the OCV announcement in the Omicron Channel, very little is known about this laser weapon.</t>
 <t id="4664">Capital Class Weapon\n\nA new weapon discovered on OCV capital ship systems, it is heralded as being the most destructive capital artillery known yet. Due to its recent emergence on the black market shortly after the OCV announcement in the Omicron Channel, very little is known about this laser weapon.</t>
 <t id="4702">The Argon military commissioned this ship after many years of speculation that the fleet's durability was questionable. The Atlas specializes in durability. This ship can withstand heavy punishment, and is more than capable of dishing out what it gets.</t>
 <t id="4712">Allegedly, a well-known eccentric designer had a hand in creating this latest OTAS M3 fighter. While fragile, this ship is one of the fastest M3s known, while still maintaining considerable firepower.</t>
 <t id="4722">As the USC has lately been known for designing front gunning war vessels, this latest design follows suit. The Arrow is a slow moving, yet heavy shielded heavy weapons platform.</t>
 <t id="4834">This is a specialised device originally developed for spy missions by the Paranid. It renders the ship invisible to gravidar and the naked eye. It is now considered highly illegal in most sectors. There are rumours that each race military has a covert operations squadron equipped these devices.</t>
 <t id="4901">{17,4905} {17,1000}</t>
 <t id="4902">This factory products the nimble Sting missile.</t>
 <t id="4905">{17,4903} {17,1004}</t>
 <t id="4906">The USC lacked a nimble missile which was anywhere near capable of catching distant scout ships. The Sting is designed to travel fast and agile.</t>
 <t id="4907">{17,4913} {17,1004}</t>
 <t id="4908">The Needle is a recent ATF design intended to fill the role of a light craft dumbfire missile. Faster than most, and pack a punch, the Needle has already become a favourite with Terran pilots during close quarter combat.</t>
 <t id="4909">{17,4923} {17,1004}</t>
 <t id="4910">Of the recently release design specifications for a new suite of USC and ATF missile ordnance, the Thorn contains the largest damage potential. A dumbfire missile, the Thorn fires fast and true to close quarter targets.</t>
 <t id="4911">{17,4907} {17,1000}</t>
 <t id="4912">This factory products the lightning quick short range Needle missile.</t>
 <t id="4921">{17,4909} {17,1000}</t>
 <t id="4922">This factory products the short range Thorn missile.</t>
 <t id="4933">{17,532} {17,16391}</t>
 <t id="4934">The Yaki Shipyard is the heart of the Yaki pirate faction. Aside from ship and factory production, the Yaki's main base of operations is also stationed here.</t>
 <t id="4954">Light Class Weapon\n\nThis weapon is one of the few smaller craft weapons that fire solid projectiles. It consists of a rapid feed multi barrelled cannon, which is capable of delivering a large number of small projectiles to its target in a short period of time. As such, the Mass Driver is the most efficient weapon of its class. The trade-off for its renown efficiency is a shorter range, and mediocre damage output.</t>
 <t id="4961">{17,5213} {17,1000}</t>
 <t id="4962">This factory produces artificial fertilizer from minerals and food by-products.</t>
 <t id="4963">{17,5213}</t>
 <t id="4964">As all races produce food products in a tight market, fertilizers are a hot commodity for those farmers who need a leg up on the competition. Artificial fertilizers are manufactured from minerals and various food products.</t>
 <t id="5545">{17,5551}</t>
 <t id="5546">Debris is the remnants of asteroids, destroyed long ago in some cataclysmic event. They are found in large debris asteroid fields throughout the galaxy. Prospectors and mining entrepreneurs are often seen mining these rocks in hopes of striking it rich. As opposed to asteroids, in debris form, rare minerals and crystals are exposed in what would otherwise be too difficult for normal industrial processes to extract.</t>
 <t id="5604">Used mainly in lasers, rays, and radiation-emitting medical equipment, red crystals are usually sold in bulk. Recently, it has seen use in decorative applications for the exteriors of buildings, vehicles, and landscapes.</t>
 <t id="5614">Blue crystal composes the core of the Jonferson matter/antimatter annihilation engine. It stabilize the matter/antimatter reaction and keeps it from going critical. The relative rarity of this crystal means it catches a rather hefty price on the mineral market. Other applications are known to range from special-case scenario electrical insulation to heat shielding on various space craft.</t>
 <t id="5624">This crystal is considered a precious commodity in most cultures. Other than it's decorative properties, it has unique abilities when in the hands of capable Boron shipbuilders. "Shimmer Scale" allows Boron bioengineers to grow the organic hull matrix found on all Boron vessels.</t>
 <t id="5634">This rare crystal is vital for the construction of jump drives, and acts as a conductor for the negative energy field created by the drive's exotic matter core. Most megacorporations with a stake in interfacing with negative energy have long since established mining colonies in quiet sectors for the sole purpose of extracting this useful material.</t>
 <t id="5654">Known for its useful applications in space-based industry due to its unmatched density, black crystal is rarely traded for long before being shipped to a final owner. As one of the more rare materials in the known Universe, black crystal is often used in extremely exclusive jewelry and decoration.</t>
 <t id="5713">Combat Command Software MK1</t>

When autojump is enabled with an Emergency Retreat Drive system installed, an escape jump will take place within 1 to 2 seconds, consuming the core. The number of cores consumed is based on ship class: TM: 6, M8: 10, M6: 17,TL: 20, M7: 45, M1: 85, M2: 125</t>
 <t id="5823">Docking Transporter Extension</t>
 <t id="5824">Docking Transporter Extension is a device that works in conjunction with the Carrier Command Software. The technology enables the Transporter Device to lock onto ships and transport them as though they were creates floating in space. Using this device, ships can dock and launch without exposing them to traditional tedious and hazardous navigation.</t>
 <t id="6012">The disruptor missile is an invention of the pirate faction The Yaki. The missile's impact unleashes ion particles to enhance its payload, which is considered relatively modest. The missile is commonly used agains heavy fighters and M6 ships.</t>
 <t id="6232">The Penatron was first spotted during a sustained pirate invasion in Elena's Fortune. To the Argon's surprise, this new ship didn't appear to be based off of any previously existing ship designs. Though not the fastest M3 in the known pirate fleet, this feared fighter craft dishes out substantial punishment.</t>
 <t id="6332">This swift M6 is an upgrade to the already venerable Dragon series of corvettes. Sporting one of the heavier weapon capabilities of other ships in its class, the Appallox is a fearsome quick strike craft.</t>
 <t id="6514">The rapier missile has very little combat ability on its own. The missile is designed to be fired in large numbers and overwhelm agile scout craft from a distance.</t>
 <t id="6524">The firelance missile is a favourite close-quarters pirate weapon; a medium damage footprint with a rapid fire ability and shocking velocity.</t>
 <t id="6534">A common and reliable police weapon, the wildfire is used to assault fighter craft from a distance.</t>
 <t id="6544">Expensive, but devastating, the windstalker dumbfire missile is an incredible weapon in the hands of a skilled pilot.</t>
 <t id="6554">Banshee missiles are one of the more respected and feared weapons in the known Universe. Capable of heavy damage and solid agility, there is little the banshee isn't tuned to eliminate.</t>
 <t id="6564">Beluga missiles are heavy hitting slow weapons often used against large capital ships and space stations.</t>
 <t id="6574">The hammerhead was designed to be used against space stations or slower moving capital ships. With surprising agility for a torpedo, the payload on this weapon is considerable.</t>
 <t id="6714">Tool Class Laser\n\nThe repair laser is a small utility tool designed to repair a ships hull. Though impatient pilots often veer for the nearest shipyard when their hulls are damaged, the repair laser can patch up small damage with relative ease in a spacesuit. All repair lasers come with a warning that the beam damages shields, and a pilot should repair their ship in safe space.</t>
 <t id="6734">The fastest of the dumbfire missiles, the firefly is used liberally in combat. Its low manufacturing cost renders the weapon expendable most cases. Though light in damage, once aimed correctly, this missile will almost always catch its target.</t>
 <t id="6744">The mainstay of commonwealth fleets, the thunderbolt is a trusted middle of the line armament. With considerable manoeuvrability for its damage footprint, a wide range of smaller craft often fall victim to the thunderbolt's payload. As the missile is a heatseaker, it will search out the engines of a ship as a target.</t>
 <t id="6754">With no lock required, tempests are often seen spilled into the thick of space combat in high numbers. The combat ability of the tempest is middle of the line, and commonly used in large fighter battles.</t>
 <t id="6764">A favourite against scout craft and light fighters. The hurricane is fast and accurate, and usually hits its mark.</t>
 <t id="6784">A feared missile for good reason, the cyclone is a slow anti-capital ship weapon capable of devastating payloads.</t>
 <t id="6794">A feared high-yield dumbfire missile, the tornado is most devastating against capital ships when used from a fighter craft. Many frigates have been reported to losing their hulls due to underestimating a small wing of fighters armed with these killers.</t>
 <t id="6804">A somewhat unwieldy weapon, the typhoon rewards the skilled pilot with one of the most devastating damage potentials in a multi-warhead missile.</t>
 <t id="6814">As with most torpedoes, the firestorm pack a heavy punch with little manoeuvrability to speak of. Usually fired against stations or military bases.</t>
 <t id="6824">The aurora missile is an extremely versatile weapon. Though it is a dumbfire, the high velocity and heavy damage make this a perfect weapon for close combat against any vessel.</t>
 <t id="6834">The Remote Guided Warhead is a heavy payload torpedo often used against space stations. It is fired normally, however the pilot can take remote control to position the missile into an accurate firing line.</t>
 <t id="7851">Shield Prod. Facility 1 GJ</t>
 <t id="7934">Heavy Class Weapon\n\nThe Concussion Impulse Generator is a technology based on the merits of both the Incendiary Bomb Launcher and the High Energy Plasma Thrower. The capable burst of projectiles launched from this weapon may be slow, but they have good range and unmatched stopping power for the weapon's class.</t>
 <t id="8004">Light Class Weapon\n\nThis is a basic laser that is used in many light weapons and smaller fighter craft. It has a high fire rate, fast projectile, and is an excellent weapon for missile defence purposes. The Impulse Ray Emitter is one of the oldest energy based weapons around. They require little energy for a basic defensive weapon. It is unknown when the weapon was first developed.</t>
 <t id="8014">Light Class Weapon\n\nA long range weapon found in some medium and large fighters. The first of its class were developed by the Paranid and Argon. The weapon fires particles that are polarised and focused into a tight energy pulse.</t>
 <t id="8034">Medium Class Weapon\n\nSpecially designed for M3 class fighter pilots who choose agility over brawn, the PRG is intended to be lighter and faster than HEPTs. It also servers as a middle ground weapon for M4 class craft. The Phased Repeater Gun fires in quick bursts of 3 rounds and is ideal for taking out fast and hard-to-hit enemy fighters.</t>
 <t id="8044">Medium Class Weapon\n\nThe Energy Bolt Chaingun was designed by the Teladi as an answer to the Mass Driver. It fires "bolts" of stored energy designed to damage enemy ships as effectively as any energy or plasma based weapon, while putting less strain on the ship's generator. It's well known that the Energy Bolt Chain gun sports one of the longest ranges of interceptor class weaponry.</t>
 <t id="8054">Medium Class Weapon\n\nThe Fragmentation Bomb Launcher was created by the Paranid as an anti-fighter weapon that causes more damage with a lower rate of fire. It releases an unstable projectile that was found to be very effective against fighter craft. The FBL is a middle of the line weapon, with modest capabilities in every respect.</t>
 <t id="8064">Medium Class Weapon\n\nA heavy hitting fighter weapon, this cannon fires bolts of highly charged plasma at relatively low velocities. The HEPT boasts the longest range of any of the medium class weapons, but at the cost of a steep energy requirement.</t>
 <t id="8084">Medium Class Weapon\n\nThe Pulsed Beam Emitter employs a high-tech system that uses directed beams of rapidly fired energy to produce a weapon of respectable fire power. Though not a heavy hitting weapon, this laser makes up for its lack of stopping power with high speed, relatively high rate of fire, and modest efficiency.</t>
 <t id="8094">Medium Class Weapon\n\nThe PBG is a short range, heavy hitting weapon designed to quickly unload a ship's capacitor. The devastating plasma bolts unleashed from the PBG are relatively slow moving, and consume energy at a rapid rate compared to other weapons of its class.</t>
 <t id="8104">Medium Class Weapon\n\nThe Earth Fleet's powerful and highly advanced Electro-Magnetic Plasma Cannon is the most common weapon found on Terran fighters. It uses powerful EM field generators to propel concentrated plasma bolts at enemies. It is the standard medium fighter craft weapon that hosts very capable set of specifications.</t>
 <t id="8124">Heavy Class Weapon\n\nIn addition to being effective against shields, the Ion Pulse Generator sports a fast projectile, excellent range, and heavy damage. A truly capable weapon among heavy class weapons, it's a common armament on corvette class vessels. This weapon has the capability of disrupting a ship's weapon system.</t>
 <t id="8134">Heavy Class Weapon\n\nDeveloped from reverse-engineered Boron ion weapon technology, the Ion Shard Railgun fires ionised "shards" of super-heated plasma, which are then accelerated to high speed using magnets. This combination can wreak havoc on weapons systems.</t>
 <t id="8144">Heavy Class Weapon\n\nThe mainstay of the corvette fleet, this weapon has the ability to unload a high powered volley of anti-matter at its target. While more capable than the GRC in every respect, the MAML requires more energy to maintain its fire power.</t>
 <t id="8154">Capital Class Weapon\n\nThe Flak Artillery Array was designed as an anti-fighter weapon offering lightning quick projectiles that are nearly impossible to evade. The projectiles stun ships for a short duration on impact.</t>
 <t id="8164">Capital Class Weapon\n\nA heavy cousin to the Flak Artillery Array, the CFA is also an anti-fighter weapon. With heavier output and greater range at the cost of speed and accuracy, this weapon is ideally suited for heavy-fighter engagements. The projectiles stun ships for a short duration on impact.</t>
 <t id="8174">Capital Class Weapon\n\nThis weapon was designed for accurate defensive capability at long ranges. The Phased Array Laser Cannon fires lightning quick bolts of supercharged energy at long ranges.</t>
 <t id="8184">Heavy Class Weapon\n\nOriginally developed by the Teladi and Paranid, the PSG has since been improved by the Paranid to be a powerful capital ship weapon, extremely useful for defending against multiple fighter targets. The high-tech cannon unleashes compressed packages of phased energy. Due to the projectile's nature, ships hit with this weapon have a temporary reduction in speed.</t>
 <t id="8194">Capital Class Weapon\n\nCommonly used by United Space Command capital ships, the Starburst Shockwave Cannon is an advanced, energy-based version of the rather basic flak weapons used by other races. It is the heaviest flak weapon of its type, offering the greatest damage output and range at the cost of efficiency and projectile speed. The projectiles stun ships for a short duration on impact.</t>
 <t id="8204">Capital Class Weapon\n\nFirst developed by Professor Jo Bydnah of the Argon, the Photon Pulse Cannon became a favourite of the argon Military, who then sold the original designs on to the other races. This type of weapon is extremely powerful, and can only be fitted on the larger Capital craft. It works by sending highly charged photon radiation through a series of coils, that multiplies the charge, creating a very deadly pulse of radiation.</t>
 <t id="8214">Capital Class Weapon\n\nUpscaling IPG technology and taking advantage of the massive energy available to capital ships, the Ion Cannon is the pinnacle of Boron ion weaponry. A huge amount of ion energy is concentrated into a single projectile and can disrupt a target ship's weapon systems in addition to causing massive damage to shield energy.</t>
 <t id="8224">Capital Class Weapon\n\nThe Teladi designed this matter based low-tech solution in a bid to save money on expensive capital ship energy generators. The Gauss Cannon uses magnetic coils to accelerate large ionised slugs that travel at alarming range and velocity.</t>
 <t id="8234">Capital Class Weapon\n\nUnable to easily gain possession of high-tech capital ship weapons, pirates designed this as an alternative. The Incendiary Bomb Launcher essentially produces a large ball of fiery plasma, which is launched at the target. A crude weapon, this capital design offers a good balance between speed, range, and damage.</t>
 <t id="8244">Capital Class Weapon\n\nRecently developed by Terran scientists, the Point Singularity Projector essentially launches tiny clusters of semi-singularities. The singularities eventually destabilise, collapse, and releases a tremendous amount of energy.</t>
 <t id="8254">Lasertower Class Weapon\n\nThe plasma beam cannon is a marvel of weapon technology. Mounted on defensive installations throughout most sectors, this laser is often a pirates worst enemy. The beam is capable of hitting targets at a great range, and lands targets instantaneously. All this, coupled with a decent damage potential, is the reason it was defaulted to nearly all known laser tower systems.</t>
 <t id="8264">Capital Class Weapon\n\nThis weapon launches heavy mortars of superheated plasma. The Tri-Beam Cannon is the heavier cousin of the Phased Array Laser Cannon. While the TBC has a slower projectile than the PALC, it makes up for this shortcoming with a greatly increased damage capacity.</t>
 <t id="8274">Capital Class Weapon\n\nThe Fusion Beam Cannon is a weapon comparable to the commonwealth's PALC and TBC. Not to be outclassed by other races weaponry, the USC opted for a projectile based on perpetual fusion reactions. The result is a devastating long range weapon.</t>
 <t id="8301">Red Mineral</t>
 <t id="8302">This softly glowing red sand can be processed into a low-grade fuel favoured by the price-conscious Teladi. The extreme toxicity of the so-called ‘RedBurn’ oil was revealed after wreckage from a Teladi tanker, caught in the crossfire of a Split raid into Kingdom End, crashed into the seas of the Boron homeworld. The resulting oil slick created a dead zone 100km in diameter and is thought to have contributed to the deaths of over 30,000 Boron. This catastrophe, along with the discovery of the 'Orange Process', has caused the value of this mineral to plummet in recent years.</t>
 <t id="8303">Orange Mineral</t>
 <t id="8304">Long called by the nickname 'Fool’s Red' by Teladi miners frustrated by the inability of their mineral scanners to distinguish Red from Orange, this shining sand became the focus of what historians are beginning to call the 'Orange Rush' after a Boron student, orphaned by the RedBurn Catastrophe, discovered the 'Orange Process'. The powerful fuel this method creates is thought to be much less toxic then RedBurn, though Boron scientists are quick to note that tests are still ongoing.</t>
 <t id="8305">Purple Mineral</t>
 <t id="8306">The origins of this dull mineral have fascinated geologists for centuries. Its presence in asteroids runs contrary to all current astronomical models. The popularity of the ‘Precursor Theory,’ which states that Purple deposits are actually the fossilized remains of some ancient spacefaring race, has made the substance popular with collectors and enthusiasts alike, though most scientists discount the idea as preposterous.</t>
 <t id="8307">Blue Mineral</t>
 <t id="8308">The unearthing of the first Blue Mineral deposit heralded a renaissance in ship design. The first naturally-occurring room temperature superconductor ever discovered, this substance has become a key component in most laser and shield systems. The relative abundance of this mineral, coupled with its low refining costs, has brought the price of well-armed and shielded ships within the grasp of the average citizen, though the effects of this shift on the prevalence of piracy is still being studied.</t>
 <t id="8309">Green Mineral</t>
 <t id="8310">Known to Terran weapons experts as Pu-241, this mineral has been used for millennia in the construction of high-yield missile warheads. Banned by most races until recently, the theft of five warhead prototypes from a secret Split development facility has convinced the other five races to rebuild their own stockpiles.</t>
 <t id="8311">Silver Mineral</t>
 <t id="8312">The Silver Mineral is prized for one reason: It is the only known substance which has coefficient of thermal expansion that is exactly zero. This property makes it prized for high precision engineering, especially in the propulsion systems of large warships. With the dramatic expansion of race militaries in recent years, this rare mineral is in high demand, and the various race governments are thought to be considering export controls to secure their supply.</t>
 <t id="8313">Gold Mineral</t>
 <t id="8314">Extremely effective at absorbing radiation, this yellow mineral is a spacer’s first, last, and only protection from his ship’s drive. The utility of this rare mineral, which ranges from HAZMAT suits to warhead casings, has resulted in enough demand that entire expeditions have been sent to find it (and counted as failures when they returned with holds full of Silver).</t>
 <t id="8315">White Mineral</t>
 <t id="8316">When the Master Weaponsmith of the Split Empire looked upon the White Mineral so carelessly discarded by a passing pilot, he saw not dross but the inevitability of perfection. When smelted, this dull grey rock becomes a metal renowned for its strength, suppleness, and ability to hold an edge. The demand amongst the clans for a Master’s Blade has made the rare ore from which one is born the focus of every miner’s dreams and every pirate’s ambitions. The location of White Mineral fields is a secret that fleets have died to protect.</t>
 <t id="8324">The wraith is a devastating multi-warhead image recognition missile armed with a proximity fuse. It is used by USC medium and larger ships against capital ships.</t>
 <t id="8334">The spectre is a very capable high-yield missile that can cover a wide range of targets. The missile is heatseaking, often targeting the engines of a ship.</t>
 <t id="8344">No lock is required to fire this most common Terran missile. The poltergeist is a multi-warhead light to medium craft engagement weapon.</t>
 <t id="8354">The phantom is the USC's own M8 missile. Used in the same way, to harass capital ships from afar.</t>
 <t id="8364">The ghoul missile is the USC anti-fighter armament designed to be fired from M7M vessels.</t>
 <t id="8374">The shadow missile is a USC heavy torpedo designed to be fired from M7M ships. As with the hammer heavy torpedo, great salvos of these missiles are often fired at capital ships with devastating effect.</t>
 <t id="8384">The flail barrage missile is an anti-fighter weapons designed to be launched from M7M class ships. Often swarmed, fighter ships have very little recourse when faces with these weapons.</t>
 <t id="8394">The tomahawk heavy missile is an M8 armament designed to harass capital ships from a great distance.</t>
 <t id="8404">The hammer heavy torpedo is a heavy missile usually fired in great salvos from M7M class ships. A large volley of these weapons can heavily damage or destroy most capital vessels.</t>
 <t id="9061">Tempestine</t>
 <t id="9062">The Split Tempestine is a formidable vanguard corvette designed to unload vicious volleys of ordnance on a target with its 12 main guns. Slightly less manoeuvrable than other ships of its class, the Tempestine is still feared by capital ship pilots throughout the Universe.</t>

 <t id="9410">Pirate shipyards resemble junkyards more than true construction facilities. Here the remains of pirates’ victims are brought to be salvaged and rebuilt, with a single spaceworthy vessel often being assembled from three or more hulks. In a society so often characterized by its violence, pirate shipyards are surprisingly orderly places. The local Prince guarantees a guest’s safety while conducting business with the clan, though visitors are warned that the station’s protection ends once a ship leaves its dock.</t>
 <t id="9411">{17,530} {17,16041}</t>
 <t id="9412">ATF shipyards are the heart of the task force's anti-xenon operations. Transferred from the USC after the passage of the Special Forces Expansion Act and heavily retrofitted, these stations work around-the-clock to produce the most technologically advanced combat craft in the quadrant. Heavily guarded and tightly controlled, access is difficult to obtain even for TSF personnel. Rare indeed is the outsider allowed to view, much less acquire, one of the craft built here.</t>
 <t id="9413">{17,5821} {17,1000}</t>
 <t id="9414">This factory manufactures the jumpdrive core</t>
 <t id="9415">{17,534} {17,16041}</t>
 <t id="9416">USC shipyards embody the philosophy endemic in Terran space construction: go big or go home. With enough slips to build an entire task force, these facilities are focused on a single goal: ensuring Terran military dominance in the inevitable coming war. Observers noted that work at this facility increased threefold after Foreign Minister Keeli’s press explosive conference, though government officials denied that this is in response to the disturbing rumours emerging from the Omicron Channel.</t>
 <t id="9501">Gamma Ray Cannon</t>
 <t id="9502">Heavy Class Weapon\n\nThe Terran Gamma Ray Cannon was developed by a small Mars based research and development company without commission by any government venture. The design of the weapon was donated after the notion of Terran's weaponry severely lacking in mid-range fire power became a consistent target of derision. The result is a formidable weapon of considerable stopping power and range.</t>
 <t id="9503">Photon Artillery Array</t>
 <t id="9504">Capital Class Weapon\n\nPartially a redesign of the Commonwealth Photon Pulse Cannon, the Terran military designed this powerful capital ship weapon to compensate for an obvious lack of diversity between medium fire power and the heavy hitting Point Singularity weaponry. The Photon Artillery array is a multi capacitor projector tuned for surprising speed and accuracy for its heavy hitting capabilities. Unfortunately, the Split family stole the secrets of its design and has since sold them to the rest of the Commonwealth. Teladi scientists were quick to establish a working prototype of the new weapon.</t>
 <t id="9505">Plasma Gun</t>
 <t id="9506">Light Class Weapon\n\nThe simply named Plasma Gun was a surprising success during a military demonstration at which no one expected the "rushed-to-prototype" weapon to perform well. While it was clear the Terran military did require a new light fighter weapon, the Plasma Gun's simple design was expected to fail. Similar to the high energy plasma thrower, thought not nearly as large, this weapon tunes down the power to accrue respectable range and speed. The somewhat embarrassing moniker unexpectedly stuck after receiving rave reviews at the military début.</t>
 <t id="9507">Alpha Particle Cannon</t>
 <t id="9508">Light Class Weapon\n\nIn addition to the influx of light weapons by the Terran military, the ATF designed this weapon as a response to the Commonwealth's array of high speed projectiles. This rapid fire particle cannon fires a modest attack for its size with a reputation for being an extremely efficient design.</t>

 <t id="9517">Magnir</t>
 <t id="9518">With the number of Terran billionaires and space-based entrepreneurs growing, the market for a strictly Terran-designed luxury cruiser was recognised. The Magnir is the result.\n\nMade to fill the gap in the civil markets, it is reasonably heavily armed and adequately shielded, though the actual luxury aspect has taken a secondary role. Built to impress rather than please, the Magnir is the posing vessel of the year as impractical as it is fashionable.</t>
 <t id="9519">Naucell</t>
 <t id="9520">The Naucell is an unusual ship; a luxury liner designed by a race with very little sense for aesthetics or luxury in general.\n\nThe design and controls were modified for non-Teladi pilots, as even the manufacturers of the Naucell realized that the ship would have little marketability among the Teladi themselves. Even so, the ship is still built on the tried and tested basic Teladi principles of high shielding and relatively low speed. The huge cargo bay is another bonus, allowing it to hold months' worth of provisions for solitary exile voyages.</t>
 <t id="9521">Nomad</t>
 <t id="9522">The Nomad is a fast, sleek and aggressive luxury cruiser. Initially designed to serve as a fleet coordination and recon corvette, the need for such a vessel in current Split military operations proved infinitely small.\n\n In order to avoid losing out on governmental funding, the design team quickly re-modelled the interior to accommodate several luxury suites and released the design to the general public.</t>

 <t id="10282">The sleek lines of this Boron frigate imply the speed and agility of this very combat capable war machine. Designed by the Royal Boron Navy to close the speed gap in its aging fleet, the Krait has proven successful in running down retreating stragglers in losing confrontations.</t>
 <t id="10642">Surprisingly, the Yaki invested in a new M7 design that would rival those of the commonwealth races. This frigate is a capable and quick strike craft.</t>
 <t id="11182">The OTAS have finally filled the gap in their front line rapid response heavy vessel class by unveiling the Auster. A capable strike craft, this M7 fills a hole in the OTAS fleet in the medium to heavy firepower support roles.</t>
 <t id="11192">The Sirokos M6 class corvette is a fearsome machine. OTAS spared no expense as delivering perfection in nearly every aspect of this very capable ship.</t>
 <t id="11312">A considerable danger in the field of battle. The PX is the OCV fleets wing leader and common escort. These nimble corvettes pack and enormous amount of fire power for their size.

 <t id="12862">The Nagoya-class heavy carrier represents the pinnacle of USC carrier development. Recently emerging from the Mars shipyards, this capable vessel adds a fearsome heavy strike and transport capability to the Earth fleet.</t>
 <t id="12882">The Teladi security companies garnered much success with their innovations in fast fighter launching technology. As a result, they designed the very capable frigate carrier, the Tern. While the Tern would do well to stay behind the action, its capability to rapidly deploy dozens of fighters can turn the tides of battle very quickly.</t>
 <t id="12932">The Panther is the result of a failed bid by the Family Whi Shipyard to win the contract to mass-produce a new frigate class. With some modification to install hangar decks, it was eventually pressed into service as a standard assault frigate with limited carrier capability.</t>
 <t id="12982">The Yaki have developed a very capable carrier vessel, again stealing and incorporating Argon and Paranid designs into the final product. The Hoshi is now known to be a well-rounded ship transport and carrier strike craft.</t>
 <t id="13002">Along with the ATF, the USC fleet had lacked a proper small carrier class for long range fighter support. Never to be outdone by the commonwealth ship design, the Terrans launched the Akurei TM, one of the largest TM class ships available for this role.</t>
 <t id="13012">Terran weapon power generators installed in this veritable M7 have earned the Kariudo a large amount of respect, and an even larger berth. While not cheap to reproduce, the availability of the Kariudo allows Terran fleets an opportunity to deliver heavy impact power to the front lines on short notice.</t>
 <t id="13022">Their first foray into the corvette class vessels, the Yaki have emerged with the Senshi. Initially disappointed at such an antiquated design, the Yaki were soon sated when the improvements they made to an old blueprint proved fruitful in large scale combat tests. Cheap to reproduce, extremely quick and capable in their own right, it appears as though the Yaki have accomplished their ship design goals with the M6 Senshi.</t>
 <t id="13032">It was long feared that the Kha'ak were developing a frigate on their own. When the Guardian first emerged in a skirmish between unprepared Split border patrols and a Kha'ak invasion force, the Guardian left a swath of destruction in its wake.</t>

As though cognisant of Universal and civilized affairs, the Kha'ak seemed to have answered with the Hive Queen dreadnought. A terrible machine, this vessel was built for nothing but single-handedly punishing the ill-prepared fleets of its enemies.</t>
 <t id="13082">Due to the size of most Solar sectors in Terran space, the Shuri was commissioned for the specific purpose of a rapid patrol lead-point ship. With high-speed, and combat ready systems, the Shuri is an example of a successful rapid response corvette design.</t>
 <t id="13112">Another bastardized commonwealth design, this pirate clan frigate is a quick strike craft, and one of the more feared weapon platforms in its fleet.</t>
 <t id="13142">Since the commissioning of the Boreas, OTAS has received some minor criticism at the apparent lack of heavy destroyer capability. While the Boreas is still accepted as one of the most competent fast attack destroyers in the known Universe, the OTAS perfectionist ideology quickly unveiled this M2 as a sign that they are still the best at what they do.</t>
 <t id="13462">As though it were the worker drone of the OCV hive, this fast fighter works only as a transport to carry the valuable OCV resources they so cherish. This craft is often seen ferrying these resources between OCV stations, and preliminary reports suggest that it isn't a combat oriented killer like its larger brethren.</t>
 <t id="13472">The Pirate Clan Exterminator is a graceless design of raw carnage and destruction.

 <t id="16172">This factory produces construction equipment.</t>
 <t id="16173">{17,5243}</t>
 <t id="16174">While construction equipment is a mundane item in an of itself, the necessity of this product brought on by unprecedented galactic expansion and trade is considered an exciting idea by many. Modern construction equipment is designed to allow the construction of stations, planetary installations, and vehicles safely and quickly. It is vital for the economic growth of all races.</t>
 <t id="16252">A product of Xenon and Terran technology, the Jump Beacon continuously transmits large quantities of encrypted coordinate and spatial data across a high frequency communication channel through the gate network. This data provides a ship's jumpdrive with the information it needs to maintain the stability of its wormhole all the way through to its destination, eliminating the need for a jump to end at a gate.</t>
 <t id="16442">The Excalibur represents the finest in naval craftsmanship the Argon military has to offer. With internal M6 capable launching and docking, one of the most powerful shield arrays, weapon and power generators known, and a fearsome armament, this dreadnought is capable of leading the longest of engagements and the most difficult of defensive and offensive military operations.</t>
 <t id="16452">With the increased demand for weapons and shields on the front lines, the Argon federation required a ship to rival that of the Terran Bragi freighter. At first the ship was only intended for military re-supply tasks, however after many successful missions it was decided to be put into mass production in order to recover development costs.</t>
 <t id="16462">The Aamon is the result of a joint research project into the culmination of Terran and Argon space combat technology. With the best of each race has to offer, the result is a very competent front-line heavy fighter craft.</t>
 <t id="16472">The Nexus is Argon's answer to the Super Transporter designed by other races. While not a Super Transporter in its own right, the Nexus class does advance on most existing TS designs is a much more reasonably priced option than its larger counterparts.</t>
 <t id="16482">Argon military academies have long believed that an light patrol is far more effective when the point lead is a well shielded corvette. The Quasar is essentially standard argon tech, with a few enhancements; most notably being the increased shield capacity and generator.</t>
 <t id="16492">The Boron design of the Sturgeon competes with the new Super Transporters, a class of heavy shielded transporter ships with massive cargo bays. Though slow, the Sturgeon boasts one of the largest cargo bays coupled with respectable shielding.</t>
 <t id="16502">The Royal Boron Navy started designs for a relatively inexpensive forward firing corvette for hit and run tactics not too long ago. The result is the Aquata; a simple and efficient design for a simple purpose.</t>
 <t id="16512">This M2P is the Royal Boron Navy's entry into the costly dreadnought arms race. The Megalodon strikes a menacing figure on the space battle front, capable of launching fighters and corvettes, while still managing to hold its own in a manner greater than most standard destroyers.</t>
 <t id="16522">This well rounded frigate was a Royal Boron Navy experiment on inexpensive design. The Coelacanth is essentially an improved version of the Heavy Hydra combat technology platform, offering a nimble and capable M7 strike craft.</t>
 <t id="16532">While not openly debated in Royal halls, there was mumblings amongst the military elite that the Royal Navy lacked power in their M4 class wings when compared to other navies. Bala Gi was hired to design the Guppy, a faster, better shielded medium-fighter to quiet these murmurs. The Guppy is now considered a very well rounded M4.</t>
 <t id="16542">The Teladi Emeus is a powerful carrier fresh off the Company's shipyard docks. The design incorporates every detail of a high-functioning carrier and transport while at the same time offering a substantial increase of raw combat power rarely found in other M1 class ships.</t>
 <t id="16552">A well rounded frigate, this M7 was an attempt to even the options the Teladi have come to rely upon in regards to heavy support craft.</t>
 <t id="16562">Unable to compete cohesively in the M2P dreadnought arms race, the Raven is a result of the Teladi investing in smaller yet more capable craft. The Raven is a well-rounded powerhouse of a combat vessel.</t>
 <t id="16572">The Teladi skipped the development process in the dreadnought arms race and instead decided to build a prototype design that encompassed modern technology without the modern price tag. This M2 class offers extraordinary firepower for the speed at which it can respond to sector threats.</t>
 <t id="16582">While the other races were knee deep in the race to develop their dreadnought, the Teladi instead divided their research into multiple designs. One of these projects resulted in the design of this fearsome M2. With minor docking capability, the Pteranodon is a rapid response destroyer capable of defending itself against some of the most powerful vessels in the known Universe.</t>
 <t id="16592">The Paranid military had originally intended this design as the basis for their dreadnought entry. Partially through development, however, it became apparent that the Patroclus was as nimble as a regular destroyer. Capitalizing on the reduced cost and highly formidable war machine that was this M2, the Paranid branched off research to develop this ship in parallel with their dreadnought.</t>
 <t id="16602">Paranid hubris lead to the initiation of the Proteus design. With an overzealous dedication to trump the commonwealth races in the effort to produce more capable corvette point-lead ships, this M6 became an agile power house on the battlefield.</t>
 <t id="16612">As its name implies, the Cyclops is a beast of horror, if you're on the opposing side. A multi-role dreadnought, the Cyclops can launch and dock M6 class ships in an internal docking bay. Once engaged, few ships in the Universe can stand toe to toe with this veritable combat ship.</t>
 <t id="16632">As Paranid carrier class ships are expensive to produce, the Paranid military decided that another option to deliver hard hitting fighters to the front line, is a nimble transport designed to avoid danger, while still maintaining the ability to quickly deploy small craft. The result is the M7 Ariadne. While not completely incapable of defending itself, this carrier frigate is primarily designed to deliver fighters to front line skirmishes.</t>
 <t id="16642">The Teladi design of the Drake competes with the new Super Transporters, a class of heavy shielded transporter ships with massive cargo bays. The Drake is known for its overall solid design and hosts one of the largest cargo bays in a TS class ship.</t>
 <t id="16652">The Split Ocelot is the Family's pride in the dreadnought arms race. Arguably one of the most powerful multi-role ships in the known Universe, the rare Ocelot can jump directly into the heaviest of skirmishes, launch fighters, and get close and personal with the most dangerous of battleships.</t>
 <t id="16662">As more of an experiment than a serious design, the Cougar was designed to be a speeding weapon platform, much like its M3 cousins. The experiment is highly praised as a success amongst the Split military.</t>
 <t id="16672">Although the Split were developing the Taipan alongside their entry into the dreadnought arms race, this M2 emerged as a serious contender to standard destroyer based vessels. The Taipan is one of the faster M2 class ships, while still offering uncompromising defensive power.</t>
 <t id="16682">The Acinonyx is well known to be one of the fastest M7 first-strike frigates in the known galaxy. While compromising slightly on weapon power, this ship more than makes up for this with the ability to get in to get the job done, and retreat before taking heavy losses.</t>
 <t id="16692">This Terran monster was one of the first USC dreadnought destroyers to emerge from shipyards. Raw firepower, massive shielding, and reportedly one of the faster M2P class ships, the Tobosaku gives invaders pause for good reason.</t>
 <t id="16702">One of the more agile frigates in known space, the Chikyu relies on pilot skill to out-manoeuvre enemies, and strategically position itself to deploy frigate-sized firepower. This M7 class vessel is primarily designed for durability, being one of the most heavily shielded frigates in known space.</t>
 <t id="16712">This M6 corvette is largely considered to be a perfect example of how to build a war machine. Heavy shielding and a massive power generator make this front line gun boat a contender in large fleets or high-security patrols alike.</t>
 <t id="16732">Designed for fast point lead in patrols requiring heavier support, the expensive Hayabusa is known as one of the fastest frigates in space without compensating on weapons or shielding.</t>
 <t id="16742">The USC fleet was in need of a smaller, more cost effective solution for factory transport and bulk movement of goods throughout Solar system sectors. As a result, the Tepukei emerged from Mars shipyards not too long ago, supporting fleets and economic expansion alike.</t>
 <t id="16752">Pirate clans had organized their resources in an unprecedented manner to build the prototype of this fairly capable war ship. The Polacca, compared to other ships of its class, isn't a remarkable vessel, but the speed in which it was designed is nothing short of amazing.</t>
 <t id="16762">The Logich, much like the USC's Shuri, was the result of an investigation into a faster combat vessel designed to lead patrols in the vastness of Terran space. With ATF command's full weight guaranteeing the success of the design, this M6 is one of the most feared in all space.</t>
 <t id="16782">The USC Solaris is an experimental design in an attempt at creating a destroyer and heavy missile frigate hybrid. The result is a devastating multi-role battle ship capable of long range bombardments and close up encounters.</t>
 <t id="16792">The Shamshir medium fighter design was a Terran concept based on survivability of swarm attacks against capital invaders of Solar system sectors. This M4 ship has shield capacity rivalling many heavy fighter class ships, while only slightly sacrificing weapon power. It is a very capable combat fighter.</t>
 <t id="16802">The Falchion emerged as a side project for the ATF amongst myriad experimental designs. With no bore-sight weapons, the Falchion packs a devastating punch with its custom turret fittings. Slow and awkward, positioning is crucial for this veritable gun ship.</t>
 <t id="16812">A dangerous corvette striking fear into peace loving citizens during pirate raids, the Macana is the result of Teladi and Argon technologies bastardized to create a fearsome weapon. Agile and robust, this M6 is a very successful design for the Pirate clans.</t>
 <t id="16822">Following suit with forward gunning military vessels, the USC designed the Sentata as a fast and nimble forward gun boat. The main objective of this class, is strafe runs, and not long term engagement.</t>
 <t id="16832">The Morrigu is a relatively new design by pirate clans to further enhance their mid-power vessel capability. This M6 is a relatively average combat vessel, with a quicker engine than most.</t>
 <t id="16842">As the ATF had need of smaller fighter craft, and commissioned them so, the Verdandi was an offspring of extra budget room, as an entire compliment of new fighters would result in better overall return. While not entirely required, the Verdandi stands on its own as one of the more agile and capable heavy fighters.</t>
 <t id="16872">The Kvasir class M7 is one of the most deadly frigates in known space. Rapid deployment speed, heavy shielding, and power generators that rival destroyers, this is a truly devastating weapon in the ATF arsenal.</t>
 <t id="16882">The ATF released the Hel as a fitting compliment to a medium-fighter attack wing. Slightly quicker and better shielded than its counterparts, the Hel is a ship for those with excess credits to spare.</t>
 <t id="16892">The Terran design of the Bragi competes with the new Super Transporters, a class of heavy shielded transporter ships with massive cargo bays. The Bragi stands apart from others in its class with a good balance of large cargo capacity and heavy shields.</t>
 <t id="16902">The ATF commissioned this new scout fighter after a lengthy design process focusing on a more swift, yet still formidable scout craft. The Mani boasts 6 guns; a considerable array for an M5 class vessel. Undoubtedly, the Mani emerges as one of the most combat competent scout ships in the Universe.</t>
 <t id="16912">It was obvious that the ATF had been lacking in a small ship transporter to augment mobile patrol fleets. With this oversight in mind, the ATF designed and launched the Lofn, a military transporter capable of launching a larger array of fighters than most of its commonwealth counterparts.</t>
 <t id="16922">At first, the ATF were at peace with skipping the dreadnought race that gripped the militaries of other races, as they were confident in the abilities of the far superior Tyr. As time went on, however, the ATF decided to play it safe, and initiate the construction of a heavy carrier and destroyer hybrid to close the gap between competing races. The Forseti is one of the more powerful capital ships in the Universe, capable of internally launching and docking M6 class ships.</t>
 <t id="20292">Following skirmishes with Commonwealth forces, the USC were impressed with the potential of Lasertowers for protecting remote sectors without committing an expensive fleet. The Terran Orbital Laser is a reverse-engineered and upgraded Terran clone of the Lasertower. During the design phase, emphasis was moved from fighter defence to a robust heavy weapon. The Orbital Laser provides a superior defensive emplacement.</t>

 <t id="96102">The O was recently seen escorting larger OCV craft in the Omicron Channel. From preliminary reports, it appears as though the OCV have crafted this new medium-fighter class vessel as a swifter assailant; designed to reach the front lines of combat at roughly the same time as its scout variants. As with all OCV craft, this vessel outclasses its commonwealth and Terran equivalents in nearly every regard.</t>
 <t id="96103">{17,517}</t>
 <t id="96104">The R is the OCV fleets most resilient M7. Massive laser and ship power sources give the R a considerable advantage in prolonged combat engagements. As with all OCV craft, this vessel outclasses its commonwealth and Terran equivalents in nearly every regard.</t>
 <t id="96105">{17,506}</t>
 <t id="96106">A troublesome M7 recently spotted amongst OCV fleets, the R is as much of a threat as some commonwealth destroyers. As with all OCV craft, this vessel outclasses its commonwealth and Terran equivalents in nearly every regard.</t>
 <t id="96107">{17,502}</t>
 <t id="96108">A shocking and dangerous answer to the new commonwealth M7 fleet, the C is nothing short of raw power. The Xenon have cut no corners unleashing this no-frills war frigate upon the Universe.</t>
 <t id="96109">{17,525}</t>
 <t id="96110">It came as no surprise to many when the Xenon Z appeared through a gate in Boron space. It was long suspected that the Xenon would improve upon their capital K design, and the Z is the answer. A powerful device of destruction, the Z powers 64 guns around its massive hull, protected by a massive shield array. As an added threat, fighters have been seen docking and launching from its ports.</t>
 <t id="96111">{17,521}</t>
 <t id="96112">The monster, as some commonwealth pilots have named this vessel, is a destroyer of devastating firepower and shielding. Clearly, the OCV have learned from the dreadnought designs of the commonwealth races when designing this freighting destroyer. As with all OCV craft, this vessel outclasses its commonwealth and Terran equivalents in nearly every regard.</t>
 <t id="96113">{17,519}</t>
 <t id="96114">The T is the ultimate dreadnought of the OCV. A colossus of a ship, the T represents the culmination of eons of some unknown alien technology. It is, without a doubt, the most fearsome destroyer brought to bear by the this new menacing threat from the Omicron Channel. As with all OCV craft, this vessel outclasses its commonwealth and Terran equivalents in nearly every regard.</t>
 <t id="96115">{17,514}{17,523}</t>

Upon finding debris, the pilot will mine rocks until its cargo bay is full. Once full, the ship will return the collected minerals to its home base if a homebase is provided. If the homebase is a ship, the miner will use a transporter device if it is available. As the pilot gains experience, their ability to accrue more valuable minerals and crystals increases, as does the frequency at which they are mined.{2022,9999}</t>
 <t id="503">This command will order all homebased ships capable of mining to start mining the designated sector.{2022,9999}</t>
 <t id="511">This command will outfit a ship or group of ships with all necessary wares, shields, and lasers, that is contained within a selected template. Note that upgrades are not able to be installed in space. Templates are created using the template manager. Selecting "ships in group" will order the supply ship to include ships that are following the target ship. The command is disabled if the ship is not equipped with a transporter device.{2022,9999}</t>
 <t id="512">The ship will remotely drop a factory within its cargo bay in the TL's current sector.{2022,9999}</t>
 <t id="515">This command set the carrier ship to wait at a homebase, watching for flagged ships. If a flagged ship is detected, this ship will jump to the flagged ship and transport it back to this ship's homebase.{2022,9999}</t>
 <t id="516">After selecting a gate, the ship will deploy devastating trap of lasertowers in a circle around said gate. All laser towers up to an amount of 360 will be used. This command requires a transporter device for accurate lasertower deployment.{2022,9999}</t>

 <t id="810">A ship capable of transporting other ships will move to the pickup station, load as many possible ships into its hangars, and transport them to the destination return station by moving to it, and offloading the ships.{2022,9999}</t>
 <t id="811">This ship will uninstall all wares and unload them to the dock at which it is stationed.{2022,9999}</t>
 <t id="812">With marines aboard a TL, M7, M1, or M2 class vessel, this command will enable the training of on-board marine's combat ability provided the ship is docked at a military outpost facility. Once the command starts, eligible marines will attend a class that takes roughly 5 hours. After this time, details of the training will be reported. The training can make use of either Disintegrator Rifles, Low-yield Sidearms, or Terran EMP Rifles in the cargo bay of the ship. The weapons, through heavy use, are often broken and discarded. The more variety between the three weapons, the faster the marines will train. Training can take place without the marine weapons, but at a much slower pace. The host military outpost requires payment for the use of its facilities; payment varies with the combat experience of the marine, which will automatically be withdrawn from the ship's account. Payment for highly skilled marines can reach up to 1 million credits per class.{2022,9999}</t>
 <t id="813">All wares in the ship's cargo hold are dropped at the station. Wares that are installed onto the ship, and resupply wares are not dropped.{2022,9999}</t>
 <t id="814">This command enables the use of the Plutarch Tractor System. The Plutarch Tractor System is a technology that allows the ship to instantly jump an entire asteroid to a known coordinate. Through calibration of tractor beam technology and small, expendable jump drive probes, the tractor system is capable of sending the asteroid to any point in the known Universe. This includes carefully combining an asteroid with another, virtually amalgamating their yields. The device comes with a cost: thermal regulators, energy cells, and crystals are required to fabricate the jumpdrive probes. Built in safeguards prohibit the placement of asteroids within 12Km of a stationary object or within 7km of a ship.{2022,9999}</t>
