		<t id="2000">[author]\033ODiary - Entry #202\033X[/author]Our lead scientist finally managed to polarize the OCV portal, and we are now in a deep unknown universe, far from home. Hopefully, the OCV won't be able to follow us after we blew up the gate, but we never know.\n\nThe previous entries of my diary are like the stories of a stranger. All the dramatic events I've told these past months are now distant memories and the only times I will get to see our worlds again are in my dreams.\n\nWith the help of the survivors, we have managed to setup our headquarters, here, in the middle of nowhere. We got the coordinates of this place from our ancestors, who lived here a long time ago, inside invisible stations.\n\nEveryday, we look at the strange gate floating in the empty horizon. Where does it lead? We don't know and I'm the only pilot left to explore and find the answer. I must hurry though, the people will starve very soon if I don't manage to find some food.\n\n\033YTutorial: you can see how much food your people have left by accessing the Sanctuary Manager directly through the Property menu. At this point, make sure you setup the new hotkeys in the Interface control menu. You should now start exploring the rest of the universe and see if there's any opportunity, such as flying wares or bailed ships.</t>
		<t id="2001">[author]\033ODiary - Entry #203\033X[/author]What a relief ! Those jumpgates look different from ours, but they seem to work just the same. I've discovered a new sector and there's plenty of life here.\n\nMy encyclopedia updated a few minutes ago. This sector appears to be controlled by Argons, a humanoid race. There's a lot of activity going around and nobody seems to have noticed me.\n\n\033YTutorial: you will see these tutorial messages until you reach the end of the Omicron Channel, at which point the dynamic war will be triggered. In the meantime, try to make some money in order to buy food or Advanced Satellites. You can sell some of the resources you have in your Sanctuary if you need more credits. Don't forget to take a look at the products that are traded by local merchants, because you probably are going to do things manually for a while. A list of local merchants can be found in your Personal console.\n\nA good starting factory is the Scruffin Farm because Scruffin Fruits are the cheapest food to produce, but their consumption rate is rather high.\n\nDon't let your people starve.</t>
		<t id="2002">[author]\033ODiary - Entry #204\033X[/author]I met the Teladis and now the Paranids. I've downloaded some data about this universe, and it seems big enough for our civilization to rise again.\n\n\033YTutorial: in Mayhem, you capture new sectors by using the hotkey available in your Controls menu, or going through the Personal console. However, you need to destroy all stations in a sector before you can control it and be able to build your own stations. But right now this is not your priority. You must develop your sector first. Maybe this abandoned ship nearby could help you...</t>
		<t id="2003">[author]\033ODiary - Entry #205\033X[/author]Apparently, the empires of this universe have survived an OCV invasion a year ago. They are talking about the same ships we saw destroying our worlds and killing our people. Let's hope they never return.</t>
		<t id="2004">[author]\033ODiary - Entry #206\033X[/author]This universe is far from paradise after all. A few wars are going on between old alliances. Argons and Borons versus Paranids and Splits. Now that the common enemy has been destroyed, it seems that everyone wants a bigger piece of the pie. I should warn my people, find new sectors and start building other sanctuaries, because I'm pretty sure that things are going to get worse.\n\n\033YTutorial: continue exploring these new sectors for now. Your priority is to get out of the Omicron channel while making sure that your people don't starve.</t>
		<t id="2005">[author]\033GBreaking news\033X[/author]Today, an unknown source revealed important information about how the war against the OCV really happened. It seems that the Borons were trying to avoid the battle of Cerberus Alpha and did not help the Argons at all. The source also claimed that he's in possession of some evidence related to the corruption of the Teladis, and how they were making money while people were getting killed. More information on that later.\n\n\033YTutorial: relations between races in Mayhem are pretty unstable. Be sure to know who is allied to who by looking at your Ministry Of War menu. You will notice in this menu that there are a few outsider companies that profit from war by looting wares and capturing bailed ships. They all have a faction they dislike: a Nemesis. The more you are hostile towards their Nemesis and complete missions for them, the more they're going to like you.</t>
		<t id="2006">[author]\033ODiary - Entry #207\033X[/author]Cobra Gamma, the Splits. They don't seem friendly...\n\nI've finally managed to repair the ship Data scanner. This portable device can analyze a ship by hacking its systems and gives our engineers the ability to rebuild the entire hull from various resources. I must be careful though, the target will probably notice the intrusion...\n\n\033YTutorial: you can now access your Research station menu, from which you can spend time on various ship blueprint projects. Ship data must be acquired before you can research them, using the Data scanner \(hotkey\). Note that research projects can be interrupted and resumed at any time, and that several Research stations can work on the same project. If needed, you'll find a handy command in the Additional ship commands menu to add your own ships data to your database. Note that the naming convention can be ambiguous: Ship Blueprint is a finished project, and you need Ship Blueprint to build ships. Ship Data is the requirement to start researching a Ship Blueprint at your Research stations. Data Scanner, as the name suggests, only acquire Ship Data for you.</t>
		<t id="2007">[author]\033GBreaking news\033X[/author]Tensions are rising. This morning, the Argons manifested their discontent about the recent revelation surrounding their old allies, the Borons, and they said: "these molluscs should now be considered as traitors".\n\nThe war has not been declared yet, but we've heard some very disturbing rumors about large battle groups being built in core sectors.\n\n\033YTutorial: invasions in Mayhem can be pretty catastrophic, but most races will respect the Commonwealth Conventions and will not damage any stations during battle. However, as an outsider, you are not concerned by these laws.\n\nA race can invade another race if the relation between them is neutral.\n\nBeware of OCV! Soon you will become a threat and they will frequently launch waves of fleet directly into your territory. You will be warned before the attack \(you can see how much time you have left at the top section of the Ministry of War screen\).</t>
		<t id="2008">\033YTutorial: each Sanctuary works with the help of your people. The more people you have, the faster you will build what you need. To acquire more people, you can capture roaming astronauts, or wait for the natural growth. Note that you can use the Backlog in your Personal console to queue different projects. See the Miscellaneous section of the in-game encyclopedia for more information about that.</t>
		<t id="2009">[author]\033GBreaking news\033X[/author]Dear citizen, the news are getting worse. The Splits have declared war against all religions, arguing that family values should be above everything else. Of course, this is only a pretext to persecute the minorities and conquer more sectors, and they already have taken over Leap Of Faith, as if it were a pirate sector.\n\nThe Paranids are furious, and the Argons just said a few minutes ago that they will always defend the Goners, their faithful allies. However, they seem the only empire willing to defend their famous temples...\n\n\033YTutorial: all features of Mayhem are now activated and all default vanilla alliances have been broken. The universe is all yours, and if you look nearby, you will find a very useful ship. You can also take a look at the Ascension system, through your Personal console. At the end of the 5 Ascension levels, you will gain a modest reward, but to do that, you will have to complete various achievements that will probably change the way you intended to develop your empire. If you fail your Ascension, you will be able to restart it. At this time of the game, it would also be a good thing to setup a surveillance network, with your own Advanced Satellites. Good luck!\n\nFor more information about Mayhem, take a look at the "help" section of the in-game encyclopedia. Mayhem is full of features and one playthrough is rarely enough to know them all.</t>
		
		<t id="2010">[author]\033ODiary - Entry #209\033X[/author]I finally managed to reach the end of the Omicron channel. My reputation has improved and I have a growing surveillance network that I can rely on to trade and search for abandoned goods. I should now focus on building the factories I need to be self-sufficient and to give its full strength back to the Sohnen empire.\n\n\033YTutorial: for more information about Mayhem, take a look at the "help" section of the in-game encyclopedia.

You are in friendly territory here, as we honour an old alliance that once existed between the Goners and the Sohnens.\n\nOur generation does not remember this pact, but the books told us dozens of stories about a peaceful agreement between our two people. Our ancestors and yours came here a long time ago as allies, and today, we would like to ask for your help, as our universe is falling into chaos.

		<t id="2018">[author]\033YSanctuary communication network\033X[/author]Captain,\n\nDuring the last OCV attack, we managed to isolate a strange radio signature coming to their ships.

		<t id="2019">[author]\033YSanctuary communication network\033X[/author]Captain,\n\nThe OCV threat is growing but during the last attack, we've made some progress regarding the strange radio signal we received a few days ago.

At least, nothing we can see...\n\nOne guy in the team thinks that the OCV managed to get their hands on our old cloaking technology. How would they do otherwise?

These stations are here, just around us, but we cannot see them!\n\nWe are trying to build a scanner that could disrupt their signal and reveal the positions of their stations. If we see them, we can destroy them and get rid of them once and for all.</t>
		<t id="2021">[author]\033YSanctuary communication network\033X[/author]Captain,\n\nOur team has scanned the OCV ships during the last attack and they have enough information to fine tune our OCV Station scanner prototype. You can now build one of them inside each Sanctuary using Perks. Unfortunately, it can only scan nearby sectors \(up to 3 jumps\), so we may have to develop our empire if we want to find all the OCV stations.</t>

		<t id="4205">[author]\033YSanctuary communication network\033X[/author]Captain,\n\nAs you know, we recently managed to flee from the Sohnen galaxy after opening a gate that we destroyed immediately after we got here. Unfortunately, by doing that, we have cut all communications with our home sectors and isolated ourselves. At least, we thought it was the case, until now.\n\nThis morning, a communication has been intercepted from a distant nebula. The message is unclear and the signal is too weak to be understood, but our specialists established that the radio signature is not ours. Captain, there's a chance that this signal comes from the OCV. Who knows what happened after our escape? Maybe they're still chasing us.\n\nLet us be prepared for all eventualities...\n\n\033YTutorial: OCV can be pretty devastating if you don't properly defend your sectors with patrols and Orbital Weapons Platforms \(they tend to target those platforms first\). They will soon start launching frequent waves inside your territory. You can see the invasion cooldown at the top of the Ministry of War screen. Losing a sector to them \(ie. having all your stations destroyed\) will reduce your threat level. Reminder: you gain threat every 24 hours and also when you conquer a sector. It is strongly recommended to NOT exceed Threat 5 before the first OCV invasion.\n\nYou will receive two other messages before the invasion happens.</t>

Even though they appear as stations in the Sanctuary manager, they are in fact considered as ships by the game. Thus, you can only equip them with shields, missiles and lasers by using the Freight exchange option \(a Transporter device is needed\). Note that they won't fire until their turrets are set up. Also, don't forget to give a command to the OWP itself as well, like "Attack All Enemies", otherwise the main front turrets won't fire.\n\nOWPs cannot be disassembled and cannot be relocated, but they can be self destructed like any other ships through the Additional Ship Commands menu.\n\nEach OWP is acting as a decoy and represents a priority target for the enemy.\033X</t>
		
		<t id="4209">[author]\033YSanctuary communication network\033X[/author]Captain,\n\nWe have just built our first mining ship and it's no doubt that this will bring us wealth. However, some of our engineers have heard some strange signals from their radios when the crew started the engines. It seems that someone, or something, is tracking our mining ship with signals we have failed to amplify. However, the signals are strong and we have the feeling that if we continue to build more mining ships, they will continue to grow. The reason why we're anticipating this is that we managed to isolate a pattern in the transmission. It seems that there's a living code inside each signal layer, something we never saw before. And if we put more mining ships into the same sector, we fear that this code is going to become out of control, and something will happen. We don't know when it will occur, or how many miners that will require, but the signals are different for each sector, meaning that a different number of ships per sector could potentially trigger a reaction. What we know however is that the pattern will start to become unstable if we run more than %s miners in the same sector. %s and below should always be safe.</t>

My company is well known and has already proven that it can help the belligerents of a war to come to an agreement, or even a collaboration. To achieve that, we need your help, as much as you need ours.\n\nThe Sohnen galaxy is not unknown to some of our subcontractors. It's a dangerous place, but we can move some of our ships if we have enough motivation. Thus, I would advise you to meet me in %s. We need to discuss some things we cannot discuss on this network. Please come alone, I will await you there.\n\n\033OGo to the sector %s with your own ship.

Whether the OCV ignored it or just forgot to destroy it, we don't know yet, but there are probably some survivors there. One of my guys is trying to find a safe passage as I write this. The OCV has destroyed most of the gates in the Sohnen galaxy, so it's not as easy as you could think. We'll talk later, stay safe.\n\n\033OThe company will contact you again shortly.\033X</t>
		<t id="5011">[author]\033B%s\033X[/author]Dear Sohnen representative,\n\nMy colleague %s has told me good things about you. Unfortunately, he had to leave this galaxy for business. He has stated that we are currently looking for some of your people in a distant galaxy. A working gate has apparently been found to a sector called Green Prism, but our budget being what it is, we cannot guarantee that a rescue team will be sent through. However, I represent a trustful company and one that does not forget his friends. We can help you, but we need a ship big enough to bring supplies and men to Green Prism. Build us a TL, and we will help you. I have transferred a blueprint of a TL we like to your Sanctuaries, but any TL will be fine.\n\n\033OBuild a TL and give it to %s through the Hangar menu of your Sanctuary.\033X</t>
		<t id="5012">[author]\033B%s\033X[/author]Dear Sohnen representative,\n\nWe appreciate your effort. On behalf of my company, I'd like to thank you and welcome our mutual friendship. I have sent a rescue team to Green Prism with the ship you've just built. Recent reports mention a group of Sohnen survivors living there, all by themselves. It is also said that they are constantly being attacked by bandits and looters...\n\nI'm going to be frank: sending more company ships to this location is out of the question. However, we are an intergalactic company and we have some knowledge you could use. For instance, we know a technology called Gravity distorsion that allows to open rifts to distant galaxies. It can only be used to transport people and requires a strong station, but with a good team of marines, you could rescue your people by opening such a rift from one of your Sanctuaries. Consider this a reward for all the work you have done for us in the past.\n\n\033OYou can now open rifts from your Sanctuaries, with the Marine Barracks perk. Rifts allow you to launch expeditions with your marines. You can then have the possibility of looting various goods. The first rift you will open will be to Green Prism. Complete this rift to save your people.\033X</t>
		<t id="5013">[author]\033Y%s - Leader of the Green Prism expedition\033X[/author]Sir,\n\nThe mission in Green Prism is a success. We have rescued four soldiers who were there to protect the other survivors. Unfortunately, the whole mission was designed to let them escape the planet, so we couldn't find more people in that location, and the TL you sent has been destroyed by pirates. From what we know, all the survivors have fled to a sector called Blue Horizon. We don't know anything about it, but the company may be able to help you on that subject. Our report has been transferred to them.\n\n\033OThe company will contact you again shortly.\033X</t>
		<t id="5014">[author]\033B%s\033X[/author]Dear Sohnen representative,\n\nWe have read the report of your marines. You should know that Blue Horizon is an isolated sector that is well known by private companies because of its giant asteroids that supposed to contain tons of Black crystals.\n\nWe could help you, of course, but at the moment, we need to have more economical influence inside this galaxy. We intend to create an insurance company to fill a gap in the market and offer to people like you some guarantees about their fighting ships. In times of war, a good insurance can make a big difference...\n\nNeedless to say, we are still weak because we refuse to go into endless conflicts, but we know how much money there is to make by doing so. We can offer you our help about Blue Horizon for %s credits. This will also let you buy insurances from our company at any time you want.\n\n\033OGive the money to the company through the Ministry of War.\033X</t>
		<t id="5015">[author]\033B%s\033X[/author]Dear Sohnen representative,\n\nOur insurance company has now started and you can insure most ships in your Sanctuaries. Keep in mind that M1 and M2 cannot be insured, and that only the price of the hull will be covered if an incident happens. Also, the incident will not be covered if the damage comes from one of your ships.\n\nThat being said, let's talk about Blue Horizon. Many of our subsidiaries have already tried to go there to exploit Black crystals - even though no one knows how to break those giant asteroids -, but with the recent OCV attacks, all the gates have been destroyed and it's now considered an unreachable sector. It was quite surprising to learn that a group of survivors could get there... So we've decided to lead an investigation. It's already in progress. I'll contact you again when we have more information.\n\n\033OThe company will contact you again shortly.\033X</t>
		<t id="5016">[author]\033B%s\033X[/author]Dear Sohnen representative,\n\nWe managed to get our hands on a rare artefact that contains crucial data. Apparently there is a way to Blue Horizon, but it requires to build an ancient portal. Because none of our scientists know anything about these things, we decided to give the artefact to a group of %s scientists. They should have extracted the data very quickly, but unfortunately they got chased by a %s patrol. Since then, we lost all communications with the scientists, and Battle groups probably have the data now.\n\nBut there's a solution... It involves getting a special team into an M6 of the %s Battle group fleet, and hack into one of their computers to get information about the location of the data. At this point, this is the only hope we have.\n\n\033OBoard any %s Battle Group M6 and take full control of it. You can follow the progress of your team through the Boarding reports in your Personal console.\033X</t>

We have transferred %s credits to your account and we are willing to help you more.\n\nThanks to your marines, the data we have been searching for have been located on a very well secured computer, in a sector we cannot identified. However, the physical location of the data is not important, as we can hack into it. At least we could if the firewall wasn't so hard to break... We know how to deactivate it, but it requires to destroy an M2, where the source of the security is coming from. But not any M2... Their very own flagship. I would understand if you decide to give up, but keep in mind that getting to Blue Horizon is a unique opportunity that will never occur again.\n\n\033OFind and destroy the ship %s.\033X\n\n\033RWarning: destroying this flagship will put you in permanent war with their owner.\033X</t>
		<t id="5018">[author]\033G%s Minister\033X[/author]Sohnen,\n\nYou have just made a regrettable mistake. Be sure that we will ripost against your own sectors. Do not contact us, consider us at war.</t>
		<t id="5019">[author]\033B%s\033X[/author]Dear Sohnen partner,\n\nWell done! Our team has just managed to get into their core systems and retrieved the data. They also found a confidential document explaining what they did extract from the artefact data. The main part is a blueprint of the portal that could lead us to Blue Horizon. We have transferred all we have to you. Gather all the resources into one ship and we'll see what to do.\n\n\033OBuilding the portal requires %s nividium.

		<t id="5020">[author]\033B%s\033X[/author]Dear Sohnen partner,\n\nI'm afraid I have bad news. Having all the resources to build the portal is not enough. These portals have been invented by species that came from some ancient galaxies. They knew how to bend spacetime and probably had technologies we can't even imagine. In short, we need to build the portal near a gravity anomaly, or it won't work. And there's only one known anomaly in this galaxy, in %s. You now see the problem: it's a %s core sector and it's probably heavily guarded. If you feel strong enough, go there with all the resources, then build the portal.\n\n\033OSend the ship with the nividium you gathered to %s, then use the Special commands menu to build the portal. It will take some time and the ship must stay in the sector until the end of the process.\033X</t>

		<t id="5023">[author]\033MBlue Horizon Sanctuary\033X[/author]We are so glad to see you my friend! It has been ages since the last time we saw another Sohnen. When the OCV attack happened in our main sectors, we knew there was a skilled pilot who was rescuing people to go build a new life into another galaxy, but we would never have imagined to see you again, rescuing us!\n\nOur life here has been about surviving the OCV, but you have killed them now; at least the ones that were chasing us. You see, on these giant asteroids, they built ground units, cybernetic soldiers and strong anti-aircraft artillery. It's just impossible to go there now, and I would never risk it. It's a lot further that you can imagine, our eyes are deceiving us, believe me. And if you do manage to get there, you will get killed anyway, and worst of all, you will attract the OCV back to us and to the portal you have built.\n\nOur Sanctuary is from another time, when the Sohnens still owned the technology that granted us the power to build invisible stations. This Sanctuary is not invisible, but it has unique capabilities. It's yours now, as well as our faithful M1 that we once used to collect Black crystals from the distant asteroids. During those days, we also had a whole fleet of miners, but they're all destroyed now.\n\nStay here as long as you want friend, you are most welcome.</t>
		<t id="5024">[author]\033B%s\033X[/author]Dear Sohnen partner,\n\nWe have heard that the security of Blue Horizon has been compromised. Our scans revealed an enormous number of OCV ships around each asteroid, and also on their surface. Taking this new intel into consideration, we have decided to cancel all our future investments into that sector.\n\nGood day.</t>
		<t id="5025">[author]\033B%s\033X[/author]Sohnen,\n\nWe thought you were a friend, but by destroying one of our main asset you have proven that you cannot be trusted after all. Don't count on us to help you saving your people.\n\nGood day.</t>
