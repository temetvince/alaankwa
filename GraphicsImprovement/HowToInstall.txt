2.	When asked for the game, browse and select X3AP.exe in your x3 install folder.

3.	The game uses Direct3D 9.

4.	When asked, install all the shaders. Everything. All of them. Just do it.

5.	Copy Reshade.ini and temetvince.ini to your root install folder (probably named "x3 terran conflict"). The graphics mod is now installed.
