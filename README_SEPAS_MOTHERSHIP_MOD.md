# Mothership Mod for SWLU 

* Back up your save files in Documents\Egosoft\X3AP before trying this mod.
And keep in mind that I am not responsible for any damage, broken marriages, floods and earthquakes etc that might be caused by this mod.

## Credits
* This little mod is based on Mayhem by Joubarbe - it repurposes Joubarbe's code to work on a 'Big Ship' class.
It would not be possible to achieve it without Joubarbe's code - so buy him a coffee (https://www.buymeacoffee.com/Joubarbe) if you enjoy this mod.
* To Sepa for hacking all of this together and letting me host it - Thank you very much Sepa!
There is a version of Sepa's mod for Mayhem, too, if you are interested.

## Features

* It allows you to have the following on any Carrier class ship that has Carrier Command Software:
	* Hangar with upgrade and repair functionality,
	* Recycle functionality,
	* Production functionality (missiles, shields, lasers, fighter ships).
* You can only produce ships that you have previously recycled or data scanned.
* You can access the Mothership menu in ship console, under 'Special commands'.

## Installation

* Unzip to your game directory, i.e.: C:\Games\X3 Terran Conflict
	* It should not complain about any overwrites unless you are upgrading the mod.

## Known issues
- If you recycle an externally docked ship then it does not dissapear from the model until something else docks there.
- Some wares are incorect in upgrade menu.

# Dev Notes:
## Future plans (Original)
- make it so each functionality (hangar, recycle, each production) is installed separately as a ware (something large like 500 cargo space)
- make efficiency dependant on number of modules in cargo bay (more modules - faster production)
- make repair and recycle work over time
- make production and repair work with partial resources (and stop when out of resources)
- custom start of some fun kind
- balance the time needed to produce ships and 'manpower' available on different ships (now based on max marines count)
- disable the mod if carrier has only external docks, also disable recycle of anything docked there
- make 'ships in production' take hangar space and behave a bit like being 'repaired'
- make it impossible to produce if there is no internal hangar space
- make it possible to select the color of your new ships

## Future plans (Sepa's Comments)
- I really do think that moving it towards a module-based mod would make it even more interesting (like in the 'ideas' that i listed for future versions):
- make it so each functionality (hangar, recycle, each production) is installed separately as a ware (something large like 500 cargo space)
- make efficiency dependant on number of modules in cargo bay (more modules - faster production)
- make repair and recycle work over time
- make production and repair work with partial resources (and stop when out of resources)
