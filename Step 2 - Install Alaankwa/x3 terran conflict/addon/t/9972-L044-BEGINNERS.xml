		<t id="1800">[justify][author]\033WTutorial[/author]\033WPassengers will automatically get onboard your ship when you dock at stations. Their destination will be displayed on the Passenger manifest or inside their ware info panel, accessible from your Freight Bay. The payment you'll receive is based on the distance you travel. A higher reputation means that your clients will trust you to go further.[/justify]</t>
		<t id="1801">[justify][author]\033GAutomatic Delivery System[/author]Hello %s,\n\nYou have \033C{1}\033X object waiting for you. It was previously owned by %s and has been automatically transferred to your cargo bay. Good day!\n\n\033WYou have acquired a Data Scanner. This device allows you to scan any ship in order to unlock its blueprint to your future Outposts. Unlike cargo scanning, data scanning is a safe and free process. To start scanning a ship, you must first assign a special hotkey from the Control settings menu, at the bottom of the Interface tab. Scanning takes some time and to unlock a blueprint, you often requires multiple scans on different ships of the same type. It can be a tedious task, but you'll soon be able to make the process faster by building Research stations in your sectors. Note that if you lose your Data Scanner, you will be able to make another one from your Outposts. Be careful though, it's an expensive equipment![/justify]</t>
		<t id="1802">[author]\033WTutorial[/author]\n[center]\033YDon't panic![/center][justify]\n\n\n\033WWelcome to this outer border galaxy, and congratulations on successfully registering your ships, assets and all your personal information to the authorities. Terracorp is here to help you!\n\nYour new system includes a lot of redesigned menus and many hotkeys. The first thing you should do is to customize those hotkeys. To do that, go to your Controls settings, Interface tab, then you'll find all the new hotkeys at the bottom. The most important ones are: Data scanner, Personal console and Teleportation device which you will acquire later in your journey. You can affect the latter to the same key as your Jumpdrive previous hotkey, because it is now useless and there is no jumpdrive in this galaxy.\n\nYou may have noticed that you have unveiled new Ascension goals. The Ascension is a set of goals that you must complete to advance in the main plot that will get through several threats, and most importantly, will allow you to conquer your first sector.\n\nRight now, your main concern will be your poor situational awareness. You have little to none knowledge of the galaxy and exploration should be your top priority. You'll quickly notice that the new stations you discover sometimes have mission icons. To see what mission they are offering, you have to dock to them. The difficulty of these missions scales to your fight and trade ranks. It is important to have a bit of money on your main account to always be able to pay for ship maintenance. If you can't pay, some of your ships will get damaged. See the Maintenance menu in your Personal console.\n\nSome people will contact you very soon and offer you some new goals. You can follow all these goals in your personal journal. The main plot is designed to adapt to your pace. If you want to ignore an objective in order to explore, get stronger, or just to enjoy the current state of the universe, you can.\n\nWhat are you waiting for? Explore, do some missions, try to find abandoned ships and wares; and don't ignore your other ship if you received one, use it to trade with nearby space stations, or do a few missions! If you have received a TP-class ship from your father, you can also register it as a taxi through your Personal console, but only you can pilot a taxi. Same goes for Cargo Hauler, if you have received a TS. One final note: it's a good idea to stay informed on the galaxy current status. For that, use your Ministry of War menu and keep an eye on faction relations.\n\nIf you need to read this message again, you'll find it in your message log.\n\nGood luck![/justify]</t> <!-- Big "tutorial" message. -->
		<t id="1803">[justify][author]\033WTutorial[/author]\033WAs a private pilot, you are not allowed to dock to the Outposts of other factions, due to trading restrictions.

		<t id="1805">[justify][author]\033WTutorial[/author]\033WYou have just built your first Outpost, congratulations!\n\nYour first Outpost contains some precious resources to get you started; use them to build your first stations and ships. At this point, you should focus on making station-crafting resources, and some cheap ships to get some Workers. If your funds are not above 200,000 credits, it may be wise to delay your first Traders, as these ships require some investment before they can bring you some profits. At first, it's often better to start building a Tug and a Looter. The former can be an M5 for speed \(Tugs don't need to be carriers\), the latter a TS for cargo.\n\nHaving a reserve of two or three TS is always a good idea. Your Workers can be killed by Pirates or Xenons, and you will probably need a TS to trade the stuff you need, using the Trade Run commands. When dangerous sectors are identified, you can either blacklist them, or build a small group of fighters to escort your most precious Workers.\n\nWhen you're ready to build your first Traders, you should adjust their budget by going into the Logistics->Traders section, and change the 'External trade: import maximum value' setting to a lower value. You don't want them to spend all your money into one trade!\n\nDon't be too quick when choosing your first perks. Generally speaking, the following perks are good to considered for your first Outpost: Cheaper Stations, Laser Manufacture, No Food Consumption, Solar Panels and Tax.\n\nWhile everything is being setup, you should do some missions, chase bounties, or scan some important ships, such as miners. After a few hours, you should start thinking about your global strategy; where to build your next Outposts, what ships to research, what investments you want to make, what enemies you want to have, etc.\n\nGood luck![/justify]</t>

Before he passed away, he asked me to meet you in person and give you a precious device he spent the last decade to obtain. Unfortunately, the situation has worsened since I last spoke with him. Each faction is now fighting for obscure reasons and everyone seems to forget who the real enemy is. But I digress, this is not our subject.\n\nThis device is now in the hands of the government and unlike these guys, I belong to a group that honour the traditions and the memories of the %ss. I won't lie: we work against them and we have fought them for decades. Believe it or not, your father was one of us. I will send you a page of his personal diary for you to forge your own opinions. If you think we are right to fight for our freedom and independence, and if you want to join us, you will have to prove your worth. Whatever your ambition is, make your mark on this galaxy, complete your Ascension, and we'll talk again soon.\n\n\033WThe Ascension is a set of goals that you can follow in the dedicated section of your Personal console.[/justify]</t>
		<t id="2201">[text cols='1' colwidth='400'][justify]\033YThe following text is an encrypted excerpt from a book written 16 years ago\n\n\033X... on my way here. The most important thing to remember is that history is never with us, the people. The bad guys always win and they tell their children what they want to hear. Obedience doesn't make men, free will does. You have to read between the lines and accept the truth without looking back on your actions. That's what this rebellion is about: understanding the world without fear, tears or laughters. Do you think that Terracorp pities us? Can you imagine them approving a plan that would make them less important in this galaxy? Or maybe you have been fed on sweet lies and illusions. Then let me refresh your memory on the past...\n\nAs you probably know from school, the Terrans started the terraforming of thousands of planets centuries ago. In their desperate attempt to control everything, they built an AI capable of doing the hard work, the Xenons, who later turned against their people. What you don't know however is that the Commonwealth tried to fight the Xenons, but instead of helping them, the Terrans declared war on them because of their mad scientists believing that some Xenons were still active and working in the interest of their ruthless empire.\n\nAfter five consecutive wars, the Commonwealth was defeated. Each faction, the Argons, the Borons, the Paranids, the Splits and the Teladis were banned from the core galaxies. For many years, they hid in the dark corners of the known universe, while the Terrans were creating Terracorp, a giant company that will be used to deal with the "outside problems". From this day, everything was made private and the Terrans managed to influence the people to believe that they were unimpeachable.\n\nSome years later, they had this idea of terraforming new planets... They didn't imagine how strong the Xenons had become over the time, and Terracorp stole billions of credits in taxes to send Terrans to their death against these vicious machines. But then, the desire for more profits made them change their minds. Instead of sending more military ships to the galaxies controlled by the Xenons, they auctionned these sectors to the remnant of the Commonwealth, making them believe that they could rise again and become the strong factions they always wanted to be. The core sectors would still be closed to them and they will always stay at the edge of the conquered universe, but they were free to exist and they wouldn't have to hide anymore. They accepted the offer and bought hundreds of galaxies infested with Xenons. Of course, this threat was hidden from them by the Terrans. What they did tell them however was that Terracorp was in charge of these outer border galaxies. Some rules were designed to limit the expansion of each faction. Obviously, this lead to internal wars, and without leaders able to reunite everyone, we stood no chance against the Terrans. We had to deal with the cupidity and the thirst for power on one side, and the Xenons on the other side...\n\n\033YEnd of the excerpt[/justify][/text]</t>

However, for this time, they should ignore you. You should also be careful of these pirates who are roaming some sectors. They will get stronger as you conquer more territory. Finally, you should know that we will take care of the maintenance fees of this TL, but the others you will build yourself will be at your own expense.\n\nWhile you're doing this, we are preparing some direct actions against our enemies.\n\n\033WNote that you can unload a station if you are in a different sector by using the Remote Drop Station command available in the Special section of your TL.[/justify]</t>

As we were starting to celebrate our new discovery - a new way to gather our ships from distant galaxies - we realized that the signal we received from what we call "the Maelstrom" was not from any known factions. It first looked like the signature of several Xenon ships, because we know that the Terrans have built thousands of them and it definitely not human-controlled, but then we took a closer look and managed to identify one single ship. Then a few hours ago we opened another rift from which hundreds of those signals were passing through.\n\nAddendum: after another failure, we've decided to abandon our project. It seems that the calibration is wrong and we cannot identify the galaxies we are targeting. These new machines seem to have been left there for a reason, with no way to escape.

		<t id="2229">[justify][author]\033WTerracorp CEO[/author]Admiral,\n\nAs you know, our employers the Terran USC went here a decade ago in the hope of terraforming new planets for our people. Unfortunately, the operation was a failure due to a massive bug in the AI of our terraformer ships.\n\nIt has been decided that this galaxy should become a safe heaven for the Commonwealth factions. We are not here to comment on this decision. Our duty is to clean up the mess and make sure that this area of the universe can be colonized by inferior species. Beware admiral! This area is known to be extremely dangerous. The farther you will go from your home sector, the higher the threat will become. Rest assured that your work will be well compensated; for each Xenon you kill, you will be paid. Besides, we also provide you with military assets, two TLs with Outposts and plenty of resources in your interorbital storage. Use them well.\n\nGood luck!\n\n\033WIn Prologue mode, you are the only faction. All crafting times are reduced. The only trade partners you can have are company stations, and they only appear in sectors you have conquered, if the sector allows it \(see the sector description on your galaxy map\). Each Xenon station will launch regular waves against your assets if they are alerted, ie. if they are adjacent to your sectors. Note that this mode is harder on bigger galaxies.\n\n\033WSome lags and stutters can appear in the first ten minutes of the game, even after galaxy generation.[/justify]</t>
		<t id="2230">[justify][author]\033WTerracorp CEO[/author]Admiral,\n\nYou have succeeded in your task, congratulations! All the sectors are now owned by the Terrans, and your actions will help to calm things down with the Commonwealth. You brought a bit more peace to the galaxy!\n\nWith this galaxy finally safe, I'm sure the Terran Council will need our services again in a different galaxy! Head back to your core headquarters and prepare for your next assignment![/justify]</t>
		<t id="2231">[justify][author]\033WTerracorp CEO[/author]Admiral,\n\nYou have failed in your task. All your Outposts have been destroyed and there is no hope in this galaxy anymore. Abort all operations and report back to your core headquarters in the next two weeks. We have other galaxies to conquer.[/justify]</t>
		<t id="2232">[justify][author]\033GBreaking News[/author]Dear citizens,\n\nWe are living dark times and as you read this message, a strong rebellion just arisen. The Yakis, financed by minor entities, or even intergalactic companies according to some rumours, just conquered different sectors in the whole galaxy, giving them a strong power in these days of suffering. We don't know their objectives yet, but there is now a new faction in our galaxy, and everyone should be ready for more war.[/justify]</t>

		<t id="16941">Data Scanner</t>
		<t id="7172">Due to the shortage of some materials that were previously used in the making of infantry equipment, scrap metal is now often used to manufacture ammunitions, weapons and gear for marines and mercenaries. Pirates are well known for their skills in the creation of such equipment.</t>
		<t id="15124">The Disintegrator rifle is a common type of sidearm. It has been invented by a rich Family member who thought that his designs were so perfect that the gun would litterally disintegrate everything on its way, hence the name. In fact, it's a weak rifle that is barely able to shoot straight. It has one pro though: it's low budget. Disintegrator Rifles are considered highly illegal in the majority of space, even though most marines and pirates use it on a daily basis.</t>
		<t id="15114">Low-yield Sidearms(illegal), which include phase pistols and stun handguns, are widely used by many law enforcement forces and military organisations. Their limited firepower prevents them to be used during tactical assaults and boarding operations.</t>
		<t id="15134">Terran EMP Rifles(illegal) are widely used by all Terran forces against ground vehicles and static defenses. The rifle is so big that it has to be managed by a two-man team. It's only effective against targets that are powered by electricity.</t>
		<t id="76084">Mounted Railgun</t>
		<t id="76085">The Railgun is an electric-powered weapon specifically designed to be mounted on Lasertowers. In fact, this gun is so big and so heavy that the entire Lasertower is built around it.</t>
		<t id="76086">Crystal Transmuter</t>
		<t id="76087">This equipment is built from Black Crystals, from which it uses its remarkable properties to apply molecular transformation to any crystal in order to transmute it into a higher quality version. Synthesized Crystals are compatible. This equipment is informally known among pilots as "The Philosopher's Stone". Note that the Crystal Transmuter has gone through several upgrades over the time. The latest one allows it to drain high amount of shield energy in order to make the transmutation almost instantaneous.</t>
		<t id="76088">Mobile Maintenance Kit</t>
		<t id="76089">This high-tech equipment has been designed to allow any ship to perform maintenance during operation, and thus avoiding the maintenance factor to increase over time like it normally does when a ship is undocked.</t>
		<t id="76090">Carrier Repair Module</t>
		<t id="76091">This heavy equipment is composed of multiple tools that can repair docked ships overtime. Although the process is slow, the high-tech design of the module allows the use of existing materials to do the repair, making it completely free.</t>
		<t id="76092">Jumpdrive Prototype</t>
		<t id="76093">For a long time, this equipment has been listed as "Unknown Artifact 78642F". It was kept in a Terran factory, far from the core galaxies, and forgotten there while the Xenons destroyed most of the USC assets. However, Terracorp has recently discovered that the artifact wasn't damaged in the attacks. Unfortunately, they have failed to retrieve it and reported it as "stolen property of the government". They have reminded the Commonwealth that the use of quantum teleportation is strictly forbidden inside the outer border galaxies. They also stated that due to the very early stage of development of this device, all attempts to replicate it would fail.</t>
		<t id="76094">Mobile EMP Device</t>

		<t id="2282">Chemical Labs are big factories that turn general waste into a highly toxic liquid that is later stabilize in cold rooms. The environment are those rooms is so extreme that every Chemical Lab is fully automated. The Chemicals produced here are mainly used to make Teladianium.</t>
		<t id="16101">TOA</t>
		<t id="16102">Trans-Orbital Accelerator are used to accelerate space ships to near light-speed in order for them to quickly traverse the vast distances of the galaxy and decelerate them once more. Unlike Terran gates, they are from the pre-quantum teleportation era and do not allow intergalactic travel.</t>
		<t id="16103">Wormhole</t>
		<t id="16104">These wormholes are used to make space ships quickly traverse the vast distances of the galaxy. Unlike Terran wormholes, they have a very limited energy and do not allow intergalactic travel.</t>
		<t id="3731">Maelstrom</t>
		<t id="3732">This one-way portal is unstable and has been opened by some scientists who claim to know how they work. But they really don't.</t>
		<t id="3181">Trading Station</t>
		<t id="3182">Developed by private companies over many years, these space stations provide the highest standards of both comfort and technology.(||) Each station is fitted with bars, restaurants, casinos, holographic cinemas, shops and accommodation. Pilots can expect friendly welcome.</t>
		<t id="3973">Transporter Device</t>
		<t id="3974">This expensive device allows the user to teleport himself to any in-range ship without having to go out in space. It also allows catching wares from a higher distance, the transfer of wares between two ships, and the instant docking of any ship that comes to a carrier equipped with a Transporter Device. Note that without Transporter Device on the carrier, it is still possible to instant dock at it if the ship is equipped with a Docking Computer.</t>
		<t id="2022">Ore mines are mainly built around small asteroids because of the higher productivity that the low gravity of those asteroids allow. Asteroids are first analysed with special scanners for their richness in minerals.(||) Teams of robots who are overseen by miners operate the mines. The Ore is processed and transported to miscellaneous factories where it is used in the making of metal parts. Considering that Terracorp has the exclusivity on all minerals and that the Commonwealth couldn't survive with those resources, the design of this mine has been provided for free to each faction. All other designs are forbidden.</t>
		<t id="2032">Silicon Mines are built around small asteroids which are analysed before for their richness in silicon minerals. The mineral is usually found just below the surface. It is mined by using an open-cast technology where the surface of the asteroid is literally scraped away by great land moving machines, revealing the rich bands of silicon beneath.(||) These are then dug and collected by specialised prospector robots. The Silicon is processed into thin wafers that provide the raw materials for the manufacture of many technical products. Considering that Terracorp has the exclusivity on all minerals and that the Commonwealth couldn't survive with those resources, the design of this mine has been provided for free to each faction. All other designs are forbidden.</t>

		<t id="2052">Crystal Fabs produce many crystals that are used in the manufacture of lasers and shields. Crystals are produced from Energy cells.</t>
		<t id="2352">The Chelt Aquariums that are found inside Split sectors are vast salt water tanks kept inside geodesic domes where the Split farm the creature known as Chelts. These creatures are nourished and then culled to provide the Split with meat.(||) The skin of the Chelt is used to make a tough leather, whilst the fatty tissue, after exportation to a Rastar refinery, is rendered down to manufacture the fine oil known as Rastar. Each Aquarium requires Energy to drive the engines required to control the giant salt-water tanks.</t>
		<t id="2354">Chelts are natural sea bound animals that once roamed the seas and oceans on the Split home planet that the Split killed for meat, oil and their skins which they processed to create a tough leather like material. However for many jazuras Chelts were over hunted and almost brought to extinction. Nowadays Chelts are grown in space Chelt Aquariums and are later sold to Rastar refineries.</t>
		<t id="2082">A Computer Plant manufactures both full computer systems and individual computer components that are in great demand throughout the entire universe for general use.(||) Factories also create the more specialised computer systems found in all space ships.</t>

		<t id="2034">Silicon is the main mineral resource that all missiles are based on. It is usually found just below the surface of asteroids and mined in huge Silicon mines in space, or by special ships equipped with a Mobile Drilling System.</t>
		<t id="2382">A Rastar Refinery is a dark and evil smelling place where large chunks of the fatty flesh of the Chelt are rendered down, and then processed to produce a fine oil called Rastar.(||) Many races use this oil as lubrication for delicate mechanical parts.</t>
		<t id="2384">Rastar is an oil produced from the animal fat of the Chelt, a farmed sea bound animal on Split.(||) This oil, once refined, is very fine and is used by most races to lubricate the core moving mechanical parts of space stations.</t>
		<t id="2552">A Teladianium Foundry is a large factory dedicated to the production of the hard tough material known as Teladianium that is used throughout the universe in the construction of space stations.(||) It is made from mixing dried out Teladian mud with Chemicals before being added to synthetic plastic to produce the final material.</t>
		<t id="2554">Teladian mud is a very fine silty type of sediment found at the bottom of rivers and swamps on the Teladi planet. This mud when dried out becomes a hard mineral called Teladianium.(||) This mineral later can be mixed with Chemicals, processed and can even be added to synthetic plastics to create a tough flexible material stronger than hardened steel but much lighter. Teladianium is used in the construction of space stations.</t>
		<t id="4812">This stations manufactures Advanced Satellites that are a replacement of the old Navigation Relay Satellites. The factory uses delicate machinery to build these complicated small devices.(||) With the invention of sending information through the gate network, satellites were developed to assist in boosting these transmissions, scientists later added a small sensor network to the satellites to assist in navigation and long range managing of stations.</t>
		<t id="4814">This satellite is the next generation of advanced communications. It is capable of video capture technology, a new feature that was developed to keep an eye on stations and ships.(||) This satellite still has the old features that allow for navigation and information relay transfer.</t>
		<t id="16975">Hacking Rootkit</t>
		<t id="16976">This undetectable equipment is a collection of essential commands used by hackers. These commands are only accessible to your own ship.</t>
		<t id="16977">Mobile Factory Kit</t>
		<t id="16978">This equipment allows any ST-cargo ship to manufacture a wide range of products. However, this rudimentary mobile factory is less efficient than real factories, but it also allows the manufacture of exclusive products. The Mobile Factory Kit requires the ship to be undocked at all time, and also adds a maintenance cost that is not financed by Terracorp.</t>
		<t id="5414">These chips have been created by a famous pirate party a long time ago, when it was no longer possible to hack a distant ship while being seated in front of a computer screen. Nowadays, these expensive little pieces of copper are still used in secret to corrupt open ports of nearby ships. They demand so much energy that they are usable only once.</t>
